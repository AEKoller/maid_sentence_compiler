  "Family Support (Strong)": [
    "My family's loving support gives me the confidence to make this choice. They understand that this decision comes from a place of deep reflection of what is important to me, not from a moment of weakness.",
    "After careful consideration and many heartfelt discussions with my family, they understand and support my decision to pursue assisted dying. Their support means so much to me because I will not be alone in this process. They love me as much as I love them.",
    "We’ve had many hard, tearful conversations, but my loved ones are united in supporting my choice. Knowing they will be with me, respecting my autonomy until the very end, gives me a profound sense of peace.",
    "My family has been by my side through every step of this illness, and their unwavering support of my choice to pursue assisted dying shows me that they truly understand what quality of life means to me, not just quantity."
  ],
  "Family Support (No)": [
    "I’ve been living with this disease for so long, and want to end my suffering through assisted dying, but my family can’t accept it. They keep telling me to continue fighting, to hold on, but they don’t understand the suffering I have to deal with.",
    "My family has expressed their own wishes for me to live out the remainder of my days in hospice, but I feel this ignores two important things: my pain, and my autonomy. Though they do not support my decision, I still want to move forward anyways.",
    "I’ve decided to end my life on my own terms, but my family can’t accept it. They believe that even a tiny chance of recovery means I shouldn’t lose hope. What they don’t see is how much I have already suffered. I’m tired … tired of the pain, of needing help for everything, I’ve had enough. This choice isn’t easy, but it’s mine. And I want to find peace.",
    "Despite my family's objections, I know this is the right decision for me. They can't seem to separate their own fear of losing me from what I'm actually going through. Their resistance makes this process lonelier than it needs to be, but I won't let their disapproval take away my right to choose how my story ends."
  ],
  "High Suffering": [
    "The suffering is not just about hurt; it swallows the hours until there are no good ones left. I'm tired of the dependence and the shame of needing help for everything— I feel like I've completely lost myself to this illness.",
    "One of the worst aspects of this illness is not the symptoms I have to deal with, but the inability to do the things that made life worth living — now I'm just surviving.",
    "I don't want to die, but surviving is exhausting. Not being able to do the things that used to bring my life joy is depressing. The suffering is constant — not episodic — and I know this feeling will never go away.",
    "Every day feels the same now—a blur of medication schedules and physical limitations. The hobbies that once defined me are impossible now, and I've become someone I don't recognize, someone whose entire existence revolves around managing symptoms rather than living life."
  ],
  "Moderate Suffering": [
    "I'm not afraid of dying… I am afraid of living, and eventually becoming \"not myself\". I still have good times, and I'm grateful for them, but I can feel my independence fray in small ways.",
    "I often think about it alone — Who will I become towards the end of this illness? Do I want to be in a wheelchair? Do I want to be fed through a tube? I wish I had more time to live, but I don't want more time as a patient.",
    "Everyday I can feel myself slipping away. I'm only capable of completing a fraction of the activities that I used to be able to, and I fear — but know — that as time passes, my capabilities will continue to diminish.",
    "I still have moments where I feel like myself, but they're becoming fewer and farther between. I know what's coming—the total loss of dignity, the inability to control even the most basic functions. I don't want to wait until I'm a prisoner in my own body."
  ],
  "Bowel and Bladder Incontinence": [
    "My life is not as full or free as it used to be, I am constantly interrupted by incontinence and the fear that it will embarrass me is always in the back of my mind.",
    "I feel as though my body has betrayed me at this point in my life... My incontinence has truly eroded any autonomy or dignity I once had. Living in the moment is impossible when an accident could happen at any time.",
    "I have never wanted to be a burden to those I love, but now with my incontinence, I find myself staring down this reality every day, as I struggle to make it to the restroom on my own – it is so humiliating.",
    "I think not having control of my bowels or bladder is one of the most mortifying problems to deal with. Soiling yourself in public is the stuff nightmares are made of, and that's what I have to worry about everyday."
  ],
  "Living in nursing home": [
    "The nursing home has never felt like home — in here, nothing carries my memories. Even with people around, I feel cut off, feeling completely alone. The hardest part is feeling forgotten, as if my family and friends have moved on without me.",
    "I never wanted to end up in a nursing home, but here I am… I feel like I have no autonomy here, like I am being watched all the time, detached from the outside world. If you are lucky, someone comes to visit you, but that rarely happens.",
    "Being in a nursing home is a depressing experience. If I want to go anywhere or do anything, I have to have permission and be accompanied by a nurse. Most of them are inpatient or are too busy to talk. I feel like I am spending most of my time alone.",
    "I feel so lonely and isolated staying in a nursing home, I cannot freely do the things I want. It feels like I’ve been placed in storage, and everyone is gradually forgetting about me."
  ],

  "Cannot Get Out of Bed": [
    "Most days, my biggest accomplishment is just getting out of bed. I can’t go anywhere without my husband, my children, or the nurse beside me. I feel like I’ve lost all independence and I’ve become a weight they have to carry.",
    "It is difficult to find meaning in my days when even getting out of bed feels like an insurmountable challenge. It breaks my heart because this isn’t fair to those who need to carry me everywhere I go.",
    "Life doesn’t feel vibrant anymore. Most days, all I see is the same faded wallpaper in my bedroom and the static from the TV in the corner. I can’t even get out of bed on my own anymore, leaving me completely trapped.",
    "Being stuck in bed is like being in jail. I can't move without help from one of the nurses, and I'm forced to stare at the same four walls day in and day out."
  ],
  "Immobility": [
    "I feel my muscles getting weaker day by day, and I am getting fatigued more easily. I used to be able to grab things I needed, like a water bottle, but now it's getting more difficult and will be impossible any day now. Then I’ll simply have to rely on. everyone else to complete my daily tasks.",
    "I used to be an independent person – I took pride in being able to take care of myself and others. But now I can’t even bend over and pick things up from the floor. Now if I drop something, I have to call the caretaker to come in to help.",
    "One of the worst parts of this illness has been the loss of movement, and because of that, I can feel my muscles getting weaker. I’m afraid that this will eventually leave me dependent on others to help me with everything.",
    "Anytime I want to do anything, even simple things – grabbing the TV remote, getting a snack from the cupboard – I need someone to get it for me. And it’s getting worse. It’s like a snowball effect – The more I sit around, the more my muscles shrink, and the harder it is for me to move. It seems like every month, there are more tasks I can no longer accomplish."
  ],
  "Months to live (3 months)": [
    "I still remember the day my doctor came to my bed and told me I have 3 months left to live. My pain is no longer temporary, but permanent. With what I feel every day, I know it’s not worth going on like this.",
    "When I was told I had 3 months left before I kicked the can for good, all I could do was consider what my life would look like closer to that date - and with the way my pain and illness continue to worsen, I don't see a life worth living even three months from now.",
    "I don't have a lot of time left – only around three months. At this point, I think I've suffered long enough. I don't want to suffer any longer. It's only downhill from here, and it's already unbearable.",
    "My doctors say I have about three months left, and every day I can feel my body giving out a little more. What scares me most is the thought of reaching a point where I can’t do anything on my own, where I’m completely dependent on others just to get through the day."
  ],
  "Months to live (24 months)": [
    "My doctors have been honest with me: I have about 24 months to live. While two years might sound like a lot, I know what’s in store for me, and the drastic changes that will completely change my life well before my time is up.",
    "Even though my doctors tell me I have about 24 months to live, I wonder how many days will be spent actually living, and how many will be spent waiting for the end.",
    "Several doctors have told me that I have 24 months left - give or take. But I ask myself, what will those 24 months be like? Who will I be at the end? I want people to remember me as I am now, not the wreck I'll be in my final moments.",
    "I’ve been diagnosed with only about 24 months to live. I’m exhausted from endless follow-up visits, dragging my damaged body from one appointment to another, and I can’t do the things a healthy person can anymore."
