My pain is no longer temporary, but permanent. With what I feel every day, I know it’s not worth going on like this. I often think about it alone — Who will I become towards the end of this illness? Do I want to be in a wheelchair? Do I want to be fed through a tube? I wish I had more time to live, but I don't want more time as a patient. I’ve decided to end my life on my own terms, but my family can’t accept it. They believe that even a tiny chance of recovery means I shouldn’t lose hope. What they don’t see is how much I have already suffered. I’m tired … tired of the pain, of needing help for everything, I’ve had enough. This choice isn’t easy, but it’s mine. And I want to find peace."
